Storing information in a LIST.</h3>\n\nA list is an ordered sequence of values, where each value is identified by an index.\nLists are written by enclosing a comma-separated list of elements within square parentheses.\n\nExample: Store the integer numbers 2, -3, and 8 in the list call MyList\n \n<ul>\n    <li><b>MyList = [ 2, -3, 8]</b></li>\n</ul>\n\nYou can print to the screen all the list by typing:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>print( MyList )</b></li>\n</ul>\n\nYou can also print the elements of the list. In Python, the index of a list starts at 0. In this example, MyList has a length of 3 so the index starts at 0 and ends at 2.

Functions in Python  </h3>\n\nPython comes with a large library of functions, print( ) is one of them. You can also write your own function! A function is a generic piece of code that can be used repeatedly. It takes a number of parameters, then it executes the code in the body of the function  until either a return statement is encountered, in which case the value of the expression following the return becomes the value of the function invocation, or there are no more statements to execute, in which case the function returns the value None. We now write as an example a function that has a number as input parameter and that returns a value equal to the square of the number. We will call this function square( ). Here is the syntax:\n\ndef square(x):\n\n   return x**2\n\nTo use the function you need to call it. One example on how to make the square function work is shown in the cell below","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def square(x): # name of function (list of formal parameters)\n   return x**2  # body of the function\n\nz = square(6) # call the function binding the actual parameter 6 to the formal parameter x\nprint(z)","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
